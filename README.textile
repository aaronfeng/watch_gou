h1. What is this:

Watch gou is a very simple program that will monitor your DB for you.
Currently it is so simple that it only knows how to do "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ...".
If no new rows are inserted in the entire database within some frequency (defined in config.yml),
a notification email will be sent out.

h1. How to configure:
  
Create database.yml, mail.yml, confg.yml in the config directory.
Look at config/*.example.config as a starting point.

h1. How to run:

pre. ruby watch_gou.rb 

I usually run the program within a gnu screen window.

h1. How to set environment:

pre. WATCH_GOU_MODE=test ruby watch_gou.rb 

by default the mode is "development"
